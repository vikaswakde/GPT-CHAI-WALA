# GPT-CHAI-WALA
GPT-Chai-Wala is a joke project that I created as part of my learning journey on freecodecamp.
It is a simple web page that displays some funny tea names, dessert names, and addresses.
It is made with HTML and CSS and published through VS Code.

# Features
<ul>
<li>A catchy title that parodies GPT-4,
a hypothetical successor of GPT-3, 
a powerful language model.</li>
<li>A menu section that lists some humorous tea and dessert names
that are related to AI concepts.</li>
<li>A footer section that shows some random and amusing addresses.
</li>
</ul>
